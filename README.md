# gatsby-plugin-bch-sweep

This is a UI plugin for [bch-wallet-starter](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-wallet-starter). It enables sweeping of BCH and SLP tokens from a paper wallet.
The business logic for the actual sweeping is contained in the [bch-token-sweep](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-token-sweep) npm library.
